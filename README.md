### Hi there! I'm Khanh 

I'm a dedicated first-year **Artificial Intelligence** student at the University of Information Technology (UIT-VNUHCM) in Ho Chi Minh City.

My primary interests lie at the intersection of **Statistical Learning** and **Machine Learning**, especially exploring how these techniques can tackle challenges in **Cybersecurity**. I hope that one day my first paper will be published in prestige journals/conferences.

* ðŸ’» I primarily code in **Python** and utilize tools like **LaTeX** and **Typst** for academic work.
* ðŸ“š Continuously developing my skills in AI concepts and practical implementation.

Feel free to look around! Contact me at **Discord**: nutbred or Email: khanhnq2908@gmail.com
